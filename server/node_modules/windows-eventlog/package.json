You can optionally pass a logName, defaults to \"Application\".\n\nIf the source doesn't exist in the event log database it will be created with the givne log name.\n\n\n### eventLog.log(message[, logEntryType])\n\nThis method will create an entry in the event log with the given message. \n\nOptionally you can specify a [logEntryType](http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/system.diagnostics.eventlogentrytype.aspx). The possible values for logEntryType are \"Information\", \"Warning\", \"Error\" and others two that you will never use :) \n\n## How it works\n\nThis module was built on c++/cli (.Net) and uses [System.Diagnostics.EventLog](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlog.aspx). \n\nIn order to log events you need to run the application with an elevated account: ie administrator or system account. Windows services typically run under the system account, if you are looking on how to run node.js applications as a Windows Service have a look to [WinSer](http://jfromaniello.github.com/winser/).\n\n\n## TODO\n\n- Use uv_queue_work to execute the writelog method in a different thread ( ? )\n\n## About win32 native modules\n\nIf you are looking on how to create native modules in windows follow [this great tutorial](https://github.com/saary/node.net/) and [this other post](http://joseoncode.com/2012/04/10/writing-your-first-native-module-for-node-dot-js-on-windows/) by me.\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jose Romaniello &lt;jfromaniello@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
